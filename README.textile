Pacer is a JRuby library that enables very expressive graph traversals.

Please look at my "Introducing Pacer":http://ofallpossibleworlds.wordpress.com/2010/12/19/introducing-pacer post for a detailed introduction and explanation of how Pacer is at once similar to and quite different from "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com , the project that inspired it.

Until I write some documentation, you may find it helpful to refer to the following specs files as well:

 - base_spec.rb:https://github.com/pangloss/pacer/blob/master/spec/pacer/route/mixin/base_spec.rb
 - route_operations_spec.rb:https://github.com/pangloss/pacer/blob/master/spec/pacer/route/mixin/route_operations_spec.rb
 - paths_route_spec.rb:https://github.com/pangloss/pacer/blob/master/spec/pacer/route/paths_route_spec.rb
 - vertices_route_spec.rb:https://github.com/pangloss/pacer/blob/master/spec/pacer/route/vertices_route_spec.rb
